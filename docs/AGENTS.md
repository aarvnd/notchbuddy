# NotchBuddy — third-party agent integration

Any tool that can write to a Unix domain socket (macOS) or a named pipe (Windows) can send events to NotchBuddy and have its own pill next to Claude Code.

## The `notchbuddy_agent` field

Add the optional field `notchbuddy_agent` to any hook JSON payload. NotchBuddy will create a pill labelled with the agent name and route all events to it.

**Validation:** the name must match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,24}$` (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–24 characters). An absent or invalid name routes the event to the Claude Code pill instead.

## Hook command (macOS)

Configure your tool to call the NotchBuddy relay with `--agent <your-name>` after the hook executable:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/nb-hook --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The shell wrapper passes `"$@"` to the Python relay, which extracts the agent name and injects it into the payload before forwarding to NotchBuddy.

## Hook command (Windows)

Same pattern with the Windows relay:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\notchbuddy-hook.exe --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Payload format

The relay adds `notchbuddy_agent` to the JSON it forwards. You can also add it yourself if you talk to the socket directly:

```json
{
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "session_id": "my-session-1",
  "notchbuddy_agent": "my-tool",
  "prompt": "Running task…"
}
```

Send newline-terminated JSON to the socket:
- **macOS (GitHub build):** `~/Library/Application Support/NotchBuddy/nb.sock`
- **macOS (App Store build):** `~/Library/Containers/codes.arvind.NotchBuddyAppStore/Data/nb.sock`
- **Windows:** `\\.\pipe\notchbuddy-<user-SID>`

## Supported events

All standard Claude Code hook events are supported, **except `PermissionRequest`**:
approval cards are not yet implemented for third-party agents (only Claude Code gets
one). A `PermissionRequest` from an external agent is answered immediately with no
decision, so the relay writes nothing and the agent re-asks in its terminal.
Approval support for other agents will be added with Codex support.

The pill lifecycle:

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Creates the pill (if absent), sets state to idle |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | State → thinking; prompt shown in ticker |
| `PreToolUse` | State → working; tool label shown in ticker |
| `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` | State → working |
| `Notification` | Rate-limit or question state if applicable |
| `Stop` | State → finished for 5 s, then pill removed |
| `StopFailure` | State → error |
| `SessionEnd` | Pill removed |
| `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` | Step added to ticker |

## Quick test (macOS)

With NotchBuddy running:

```sh
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","session_id":"t1","prompt":"hello","notchbuddy_agent":"demo"}' \
  | /bin/sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/NotchBuddy/nb-hook --agent demo
```

A "demo" pill should appear in the island.
